# Data
The data is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was recorded by 5 metal oxide chemical sensors located in a significantly polluted area in an Italian city, and I will analyze one of them, CO. The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses spreading from March 2004 to February 2005.
Below is the attributes description loaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
